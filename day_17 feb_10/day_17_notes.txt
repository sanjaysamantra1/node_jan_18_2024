REPL
====
-REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop.
 R - Reads user's input
 E - Evaluates the expression
 P - Prints the result
 L - Loops the above things until user kills the process
-Node.js comes with virtual environment called REPL.
-it is similar to Shell in Linux or command prompt in windows where 
 a command is entered and the system responds with an output in an interactive mode
-It is a quick and easy way to test simple Node.js/JavaScript code.
-To launch the REPL (Node shell), open command prompt and type 'node'.
-If you need to write multi line JavaScript expression or function then just press Enter.
 (The REPL terminal will display three dots (...), it means you can continue on next line)
-We can execute an external JavaScript file by writing 'node <Filename>'.
-assign the result of the most recently evaluated expression to the special variable _ (underscore)
	 a = 10; b = 20; a+b;
	 sum = _; console.log(sum);
-To Open REPL in editor mode , use .editor
-To Exit REPL type .exit
-if you press the tab key the REPL will try to autocomplete what you wrote to match a variable you already defined or a predefined one.
-Used For Exploring node objects ( os, fs , http)
 fs (enter)
