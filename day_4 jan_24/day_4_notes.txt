Function Curring
================
-It is a concept of breaking a function with many arguments into many functions with single arguments in such a way the the output remains same.
-It helps to create higherOrder functions.

// Function Curring
let sum = function (a) {
    return function (b) {
        return function (c) {
            console.log(a + b + c);
        }
    }
}
sum(2)(3)(4)



Pure Function
=============
-Pure functions are functions that accepts input and returns a value without modifying the data outside its scope.(without side effects)
-A function is called pure if it follows the below 3 standards
    1.Function Shouldn't Update the data outside it's scope.
    2. Function must return a value
    3. The return value must be dependent on input value/ argument.


Higher Order Function
=====================
-HigherOrder function is a function that either receives another function as argument and/or returns a function.
-A function is called Higher order, if that function has either of the below 2 abilities
    a. a function has ability to return another function
    b. a function has ability to take another function as argument
-Array forEach(),map(),filter(),reduce(),sort()


Function recursion
==================
-A recursive function is a function that calls itself until the program achieves the desired result.
-A recursive function should have a conditionthat stops the function from calling itself. otherwise
'RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded' error will be seen.
-A recursive function should be used instead of loop where we don't know how many times the loop needs to be executed.
