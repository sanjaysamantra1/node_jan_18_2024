What NodeJs is?
===============
-Opensource and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
-Allows to run JavaScript on the server(outside the browser).
-Built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. 
-Single threaded, non-blocking, and event-driven execution model.
-It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications. 
-ex:video streaming sites, real-time chat application, Game servers and web applications.
-It's not the best choice for CPU intensive work.(Complex calculations)


	Browser					 Node.js
======================================================
-DOM (document)				-No DOM
-Window						-No Window (global)
-Cookies					-No Cookies
-Offline Storage            -No Offline Storage
-No FileSystem				-FileSystem
-Database Interaction(No)	-Database Interaction(yes)
-Client Apps/ UI			-Server side Apps / Back-End



Key Features of Node.js
=======================
Asynchronous and Event Driven:
	All APIs of Node Js are asynchronous. 
	This feature means that if  Node receives a request for some Input/Output operation, it will execute that operation in the background and continue with the processing of other requests. 
	Thus it will not wait for the response from the previous requests.
It's very fast:
	Node Js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one which is used by Google Chrome. 
	Node has a wrapper over the JavaScript engine which makes the runtime engine much faster and hence processing of requests in NodeJS is faster.
Single Threaded but Highly Scalable:
	Node Js uses a single thread model for event looping. 
	The response from these events may or may not reach the server immediately. 
	However, this does not block other operations. 
	Thus making Node.js highly scalable. 
	Traditional servers create limited threads to handle requests while Node.js creates	a single thread that provides service to much larger numbers of such requests.
Node js library uses JavaScript:
	The majority of developers are already well-versed in JavaScript. 
	Hence, development in Node.js becomes easier for a developer who knows JavaScript.
Community –
	There is an Active and vibrant community for the Node Js framework - The active community always keeps the framework updated with the latest trends in the web development.
No Buffering –
	Node js applications never buffer any data. 
	They simply output the data in chunks.
NPM (Node Package Manager)–
	it comes with node js & allows us to install various Packages for Node js Application. (lodash,cors,axios,express)



V8 JavaScript Engine
====================
-V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome.
-V8 takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome.
-The same V8 Engine is used in NodeJS also.
-V8 is written in C++, and it's continuously improved.
-JavaScript is generally considered an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines no longer just interpret JavaScript, they compile it.
-JavaScript is internally compiled by V8
